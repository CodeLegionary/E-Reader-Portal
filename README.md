# E-Reader-Portal
## INTRO
A web-based platform for reading eBooks with authentication, reading progress tracking, and review features. Includes database-backed data persistence.

## Structure
The full-stack application is divided into two clearly distinct parts: 'demo,' which encapsulates the backend and authentication management, is written in Java (Maven + Spring-Boot), while 'Vite-Jsx' handles the dynamic part, developed with React.

## INFORMATION
The working application is in the branch 'local-dev', you can launch and test it on your machine by following the relevant instructions in that branch. This branch 'main', on the other hand, is a work-in-progress prototype that could be deployed in the future. For now, distribution is not intended, as this is simply a demonstration project, but with the right hosting and payment plan this app could be eventually distributed.

### DISCLAIMER
As per the above information, this application is strictly a demonstration project and is not intended for public distribution or commercial deployment at this time. All rights reserved.
